## Simulating chaotic behavior of bouncing balls

Inspired by [this numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z4qRhpBIyA).

The balls start at almost the same position but after just a few bounces their paths differ wildly.

Requires Pygame. Run simulation.py to start. Press spacebar to pause or unpause.
